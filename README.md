# Mental Yoga Challenge

## Idea

##### Mental stress and anxiety are very commonly reported disorders in school students specially during corona times, when they are not leaving the house and meeting their friends at school. Yoga is a form of mental excercize well known to reduce stress.We have created a challenge sharing portal where one can create open challenges related to mental health, mainly including mental yoga and stress relieving excercise postures. One can reply to these challenge videos with own video doing the same posture or challenging friends with a new pose. We believe this target based activity will be a fun filled stress buster for all across ages.
